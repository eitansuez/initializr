initializr:

TODO:
1. sync with parent project (one i forked from)

-----phase 2:
write your own separate pure spa javascript implementation of the gui
  need to familiarize myself with the tooling..grunt?  yeoman?  bower?  gulp?

---DONE:
x read the project wiki
  x configuration format
  x guidelines for 3rd party starters
  x metadata format
x review controller endpoint implementations
x review home.html
x grok start.js
x figure out how to rapidly develop / fast feedback cycles - make a change, refresh page, etc..

x when page initializes, fetch dependencies into local (client-side) model
x have a template for rendering dependencies maven style and gradle style
x setup the two divs
x bind div display to project type
x each time you add/remove tag, you update a project dependencies model
x bind dependencies model to div with template
x add highlightjs to make it look pretty
x add copy2clipboard to grab it into the pastebuffer
x implement the design/feature
x understand how to build it, run it locally, set it up in the ide
x add a div to display the gradle dependencies
x add a div to display the maven dependencies
x bind display/visibility property of each div to the project type control (select)
x perhaps display div only if # dependencies > 0
x hook in to addTag/removeTag to update the contents of those divs each time a dependency is added or removed
x dependencies = list of dependency objects
x each dependency object can render itself to maven or to gradle
x view is a rendering of the dependencies list
x add a code highlighter to nicely render the contents (one is xml and the other is groovy).  see highlightjs.org
x add a copy to clipboard button to copy the dependencies snippet.  see clipboardjs.com

x one problem is that all you have on the client is the tuple representing a dependency: id, name, description
x this is not the actual dependency information that you need to render
x i suspect that's on the server side and gets generated there for download
x  there is a /dependencies endpoint that will fetch them
x need to run lint on start.js - semicolons missing in places
